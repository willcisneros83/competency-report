        <p><p>My Name is Guillermo but I go by Will beacuse it's easier for people to pronounce. I grew up in Kansas but moved once I turned 18.

        <p>I joined the Army in 2006 and got out in 2012. After I left the Army I went ot school and received my associates degree in diesel technolgy from Pike Peak Community College and began working as a diesel technician. I continued to stay in school and would earn my associates in Business and later my Bachelors in Finance.

            <p>I have two kids, a son named Brayden and a daughter named Mia. They stay with me the majority of the time and Im sure they will walk in while i'm in class from time to time. Anything else you would like to know, feel free to ask.</p>
